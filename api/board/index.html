<h2>Boards</h2>
<p><a href="#tnt.board">tnt.board</a> creates a new track-based visualisation. Typically, each track displays a set of elements defined during its setup. Boards can be panned or zoomed within their defined limits. Once a <a href="#Board">board</a> is created new <a href="#Track">tracks</a> can be attached to it using the method board.<a href="#board.add_track">add_track</a></p>

<p>Each new <a href="#Track">track</a> needs to know how to get the data to display (either <i>synchonously</i> or <i>asynchronously</i>). A new call to get new data is performed everytime the board changes its state (while panning / zooming or programmatically). Each track should also define how to represent each of the features to display. TnT offers predefined common displays (like <a href="#tnt.board.track.feature.block">rectangles</a>, <a href="#tnt.board.track.feature.line">lines</a>, <a href="#tnt.board.track.feature.area">areas</a>, <a href="#tnt.board.track.feature.pin">pins</a>) ready to use. New displays can also be created using <a href="#tnt.board.track.feature">display interface</a>. <a href="#tnt.board.track.feature.composite">Composite displays</a> (ie, displays made of combinations fo different simple displays) are also allowed and a very powerful tool for displaying complex data. Examples of how to create different visualizations can be seen in the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/examples/">examples page</a>.</p>

  <p>The above example starts by defining a board that displays data from position 0 to 500, being the limits of the board 0 (the default) and 1000. Then two tracks are defined. The first one is a location track with top orientation. The second track is 30 pixels high and displays one block from position 200 to 350 in the board. Both tracks are attached to the board. The <i>board</i> itself is a function that when executed initialises the visualisation using the provided <i>DOM element</i> as its container. Finally, the <i>board</i> is started, which means that the data is retrieved and displayed. It is important to understand and remember these three states of the visualisation:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Defined</b>: The board instance is defined at the code level, but the visualisation hasn't been inisialised and the container is still empty</li>
    <li><b>Initialised</b>: The container is populated with the board elements but tracks are not yet created and no data is retrieved or displayed</li>
    <li><b>Started</b>: The tracks are created, their data retrieved and the features plotted</li>
</ul>
